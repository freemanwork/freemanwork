    <h3 id="objectives">Purpose</h3>
        <p>- This site is meant to show my digital and print work in a manner that establishes my identity as a graphic designer</p>
        <p>- I would like the interface to show my ability to translate ideas and concepts into simple and visually appealing pieces</p>
        <p>- This site should encourage exploration, yet be simple and easy to manage</p>
        <p>- Another piece I would like to include would be small sections that show my hobbies (like making zines)</p>
        <h3 id="audience">Audience</h3>
        <p>
            - The audience that I am primarily trying to make this site for involves employers. I would think that they should be able to explore the site and learn about me and what I can make.
        </p>
        <p>
            - I would also like this site to be a comfortable piece to show friends what I am working on and potentially how they could be involved on current projects.
        </p>
        <h3 id="tone">Tone</h3>
        <p>
            I would like to keep this website to maintain a concious, yet casual tone. I think the clients that I would like to have should understand who I am as a person and see that I have a personality outside of simply my work.
        </p>
    <h3 id="content">Content</h3>
        <p> - I would first like a landing page that is able to describe part of my aesthetic even before the client or friend sees my work. The current picture I have for the landing page is this: </p>
        <figure>
            <img class="reference-image" src="backdrop.png" alt="backdrop image" width="500" />
        </figure>
        <p> - In addition, I would like to include my logo in the center that looks like this: </p>
        <figure>
            <img class="reference-image" src="logo.png" alt="logo" width="500" />
        </figure>
        <p> - As secondary content, I think it is important to have an about page that describes who I am and what I do as a designer. I would also like to show some of my passion projects like zines. These were not made for clients, they were simply ways to enjoy the process and make things with friends. </p>
    <h3 id="sitetree">Site Tree</h3>
        <p> Following is a potential site tree for the website. The initial page will function as a home and landing page with the backdrop mentioned. From there, a user can click on the links to specific work that I have attached. The work that they will see will include only one image that they can click to go further into the gallery of what the project consisted of.
