    <h1>Hey! These are the changes I would like to make for the next couple weeks.</h1>
        <h3>I like my porfolio site, but I'm not done quite yet. The changes that I would like to continue with involve more dynamic features to make it a little bit "smoother".</h3>
        <h3> Check this out. In this site, the left column follows as the user scrolls down, I think this is a nice interaction that makes a two column site look a little more professional. </h3>
            <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="http://workhackathon.com/">Work Hackathon</a>
        </li>
                </ul>
        <img src="img/workhackathon.png" alt="workhackathon">
        <h3> 
        From here I think I need a way to allow people to get a better look at my work. If you look at this website it has a feature where you click the work and it has more of a "zoomed" feature so you can see it better for the screen.
        </h3>
            <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="http://clairepedersen.com/projects/cupcake.html">Claire Pedersen</a>
        </li>
                </ul>
         <img src="img/claire.png" alt="clairelink">
        <h3> 
        Lastly, I want to look at random elements that can move and be able to interact. I want the background image for example to have the little pixels move around and be able to be manipulated by the user. This is sort of an example, a way to use javascript or some other language to bring a little more weirdness to the site.

            <ul>
         <li>

         <img src="img/imok.png" alt="okay good">
        <h3> 
        Random thing, could I have a section where people can draw around and create things? I thought this was really cool. Maybe just to have a random link where people can draw on the background that I made.
